# Quran-Website
# Quran-Website Tabarak website for the Noble Qurâ€™an was designed by me using (HTML, CSS) language, and it was completed within 36 hours and I am very proud of this wonderful work.  The site was designed and worked on by me,  and this was by the grace of God and Professor Osama Al-Zero.  It was difficult to work on it, but I continued so that God would make it in the balance of our good deeds and perhaps benefit us in the hereafter. The site is compatible with all screen sizes and I will work on developing it in the future.  The existing Quran is downloaded from the website "www.mp3quran.net".
